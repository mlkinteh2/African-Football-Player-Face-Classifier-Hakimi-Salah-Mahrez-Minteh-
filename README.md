#  African Football Player Face Classifier (Flask Web App)

A Flask-based web application that recognizes African football players from their facial images using **Machine Learning** and **Computer Vision**.  
The app uses **OpenCV**, **Wavelet Transform**, and a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model to classify uploaded images of players.

---

## Overview

This project demonstrates the integration of **AI and Web Development**.  
It automatically detects faces from uploaded images, extracts features using **Wavelet Transform**, and predicts the correct player using a pre-trained **SVM model**.  

Users interact with a simple web interface built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, while the backend is powered by **Python Flask**.

##  Players in the Dataset

| Player Name | Country |
|--------------|----------|
| Achraf Hakimi | 🇲🇦 Morocco |
| Mohamed Salah | 🇪🇬 Egypt |
| Riyad Mahrez | 🇩🇿 Algeria |
| Yankuba Minteh | 🇬🇲 Gambia |

> *Note: The dataset was manually collected. Yankuba Minteh’s dataset was limited, so image augmentation techniques (flipping, rotation, brightness adjustment) were applied to increase the samples.*

## Machine Learning Overview

- **Face Detection:** Haar Cascade Classifier (OpenCV)  
- **Feature Extraction:** Wavelet Transform (`pywt`) + raw pixel features  
- **Model Used:** Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- **Framework:** scikit-learn  
- **Accuracy:** ~90% (SVM performed best among tested models)
